# KingoEngine

To install clone the repository:
`git clone --recursive https://git.victorkrogh.dk/KingoBoiii/KingoEngine.git`

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

And then run the `Win-GenerateProjects.bat` file. When that's done, you should be able to open the KingoEngine.sln file, in the root folder.
